# Club Fair Website

An interactive website to be displayed at the club fair for my Hack Club. It displays a phone number and prompts viewers to text a color to it, such as "green" or "purple".

## Notes

- People were most attracted to the stickers, and then looked around at the table and saw the number
- People didn't completely understand what the website was, and what it would do, so a description of some kind could have helped
- Typing in a new number and texting it could be tedious, perhaps another way to send a message to the website could have been easier.
